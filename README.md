✨ Bringing Agentic AI to Life with AutoGen ✨

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been experimenting with the AG2 Framework to design multi-agent AI systems powered by LLMs + AutoGen. The goal: show how conversational agents can go beyond single-task chat and collaborate like real teammates.

Here are some of the prototypes I built:

🧠 Mental Health Philosopher – an empathetic agent that helps users boost their mood and refine advice until satisfaction.

🎓 Student–Teacher Simulation – dynamic conversations for learning and feedback.

🌍 Travel Planner – interactive trip planning with refinements until rated 9/10.

💳 Consumer Lending Onboarding – agents that guide customers through loan types and required documents.

These use cases show how agentic AI can transform industries from healthcare to finance, education, and travel. It’s not just about answering questions anymore — it’s about building systems that negotiate, refine, and collaborate like humans.
